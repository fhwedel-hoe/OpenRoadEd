# OpenRoadEd on Linux

OpenRoadEd is simple application designed to create both logical (OpenDRIVE standard) and geometrical (OpenSceneGraph) descriptions of road networks created by Dmitri and Egor Kurteanu as a Windows application (see below). This fork was adapted to compile on modem linux operating systems by Hermann HÃ¶hne and Hamid Ebadi.
